# ml-crash-course

The aim of this workshop is to provide PhD Researchers with skills and experience to use machine learning in their research. The topics covered include (but are not limited to):

- types of machine learning (unsupervised, supervised, reinforced)
- training, testing, and validation
- overfitting, underfitting, and generalization
- decision trees and random forest
- measuring performance
- support vector machine classification and regression
- neural networks
- ethics in machine learning/artificial intelligence
- deep learning

## getting started

If you have already installed [git](https://git-scm.com/) and [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/), you can clone
this repository to your computer, then set up the necessary conda environment using the `environment.yml` file provided.

If that sounds like complete nonsense to you, or you have no idea where to start to install those files, you can find
more detailed instructions on [the workshop webpage](https://iamdonovan.github.io/teaching/ml-crash-course).
